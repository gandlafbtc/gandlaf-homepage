	<p>Hello, mate</p>
	<p>My name is gandlaf21.</p>
	<p>
		I welcome you on what I call my home(page). On here, you can find projects I'm working on and my
		various accounts on platforms I use.
	</p>
	<p>
		As you can see, I am an open source programmer/magician. In the world I live in, code is magic
		and magicians are plentiful. Not a single day goes by without learning new spells and potion
		recipes. To learn is a must, in the ever changing world of magic.
	</p>
	<h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Magic of Light</h3>
	<p>
		I pursue the magic of light and I renounce dark magic. Spells that hide their truth and come
		from closed sources are powerful, and if wielded by arch mages they can corrupt the souls of the
		unsuspecting. There are many schools of dark magic, some worse than others. Some schools focus
		on exploiting human psychology to enrich themselves while others are even more sinister,
		targeting weaknesses in the uninitiated to either rob them of their time, data or belongings.
		Some of the commonly used spells of dark magic are subtle, luring the prey into a limbo and
		turning them into slaves. A great example is the dark spell of 'targeting', a spell that syphons
		the soul of the victims and feeds them with garbage.
	</p>
	<p>
		Magicians of light must band together. The magicians that seek truth draw their strength from
		collaboration, open source magic books and transparency. If enough powerful magicians band
		together on the side of light, darkness stands no chance.
